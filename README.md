<h1 align="center">Kanban Project Management</h1>

Kanban Project Management is a web application to manage software development projects.

> **Kanban** is a workflow management method for defining, managing, and improving services that deliver knowledge work. It aims to help you visualize your > work, maximize efficiency, and improve continuously.

## Getting started üèÅ

[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/sldiaz04us/kanban-project-management)

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

- `git clone https://github.com/sldiaz04us/kanban-project-management.git`
- `cd kanban-project-management/`
- `npm run install:all` to install all dependencies (frontend and backend)

> You can install the **frontend** and **backend** dependencies individually with `npm run install:frontend` and `npm run install:backend` respectively.

> To start the **backend** and **frontend** applications, you must run the commands on two different terminals.

### Backend application

Before you run the application, you'll also need:

- Set up [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/en/cloud/atlas), a cloud MongoDB service.

  The reason why I recommend this option is due to the use of transactions to execute multiple operations in isolation and potentially undo all the operations if one of them fails. In the application, when a project is deleted, all its issues and the comments for each of those issues are also deleted.

  To execute transactions, there must be replicas of the database, and MongoDB Atlas offers this configuration out of the box.

  If you want a local configuration of mongodb, take a look at this article [Creating a MongoDB replica set using Docker](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2016/06/30/docker-mongo-replica-set/).

- In the backend folder of the project, you'll find the file `.env.stage.dev`, change the value of MONGODB_URI with the **database connection string** from the previous step.

  ```
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@cluster0.dmpdr.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  ```

  > Replace **\<password\>** with the password for the admin user. Replace **myFirstDatabase** with the name of the database that connections will use by default.

- `npm run start:backend`, this command runs the backend application implemented in NestJS.
- The server is listening on `http://localhost:3000/`
- `npm run seed:database`, this command, as its name suggests, seeds the database with some data.

> Since there is no Authentication System in place, for the application to work as expected, there must be at least one user in the database.

> After the database is seeded, you'll find:
>
> - A Sample Kanban Project with one issue.
> - Five predefined users
>   - Myself (Sergio Lopez Diaz)
>   - Richard Hendricks
>   - Gilfoyle
>   - Dinesh
>   - Big Head

> You can run the command to seed the database whenever you want, there is no need to stop the backend application for that.

### Frontend application

- `npm run start:frontend`, this command runs the frontend application implemented in Angular.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## What's missing‚ùì

### An Authentication and Authorization System

The application uses the same user by default. In a real product, the application must have an authentication system, where users can register and participate in the entire development process of one or more projects.

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

I skipped writing test for this project.

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators, etc.
