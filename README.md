- [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) - A javascript library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the world‚Äôs most used tools, by adding static type definitions.
- [angular/cdk/drag-drop](https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview) - Provides you with a way to easily and declaratively create drag-and-drop interfaces.
- [angular-in-memory-web-api](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/misc/angular-in-memory-web-api) - An in-memory web api for Angular demos and tests that emulates CRUD operations over a REST API.


## Getting started üèÅ
[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/sldiaz04us/kanban-project-management)

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

- `git clone https://github.com/sldiaz04us/kanban-project-management.git`
- `cd kanban-project-management/frontend/` 
- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm run start` this command runs the frontend application implemented in angular.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

This project mimics communication with a remote data server by using the [in-memory-web-api](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/misc/angular-in-memory-web-api) module. By default this service adds a 500ms delay to all data requests to simulate round-trip latency, but you can change or eliminate the latency by setting a different `delay` value:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    ...
    HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModule.forRoot(AppData, { delay: 10 }), // 10ms delay
    ...
  ],
  providers: [
    ...
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```


## What's missing‚ùì
### A Real Backend Api
Currently this project use **angular-in-memory-web-api** to emulates CRUD operations over a REST API, so the application data is stored in memory and every time the web is reloaded, the data will be restored. In the future, the backend will be implemented with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.

### An Authentication and Authorization System
The application uses the same user by default. In a real product, the application must have an authentication system, where users can register and participate in the entire development process of one or more projects.

### Unit/Integration tests üß™
I skipped writing test for this project. I might do it for the real backend api with NestJS.

### Accessibility ‚ôø
Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators, etc.
